These days I'm working hard to finish the final project of this term. [Check the project Repo](https://github.com/ChenWendi2001/Principles-and-Practice-of-Problem-Solving).

Also, I spare some time to learning Deep Learning and Machine Learing. [Check the cs231n assignment Repo](https://github.com/ChenWendi2001/cs231n-assignments).
